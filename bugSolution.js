The issue is likely due to an incorrect or missing `content` array within your `tailwind.config.js` file.  Make sure the `content` array points to all the files in your project that contain Tailwind CSS classes.  For example:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './index.html',
    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Ensure that your paths are correctly specified and that the file extensions listed cover all your template files.  If you're using a framework like Next.js, Vue, or React, refer to their Tailwind CSS integration guides for specific instructions on configuring the `content` array.
